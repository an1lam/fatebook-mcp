# To Dos
## For MVP
- [x] Switch over to structured responses using pydantic
- [ ] Add resource versions of questions
- [ ] Add instructions for how to set up with Claude Code
- [ ] Remove null fields from responses to avoid wasting context
- [ ] Clean up test_client.py, since Claude has left it a bit of a mess
